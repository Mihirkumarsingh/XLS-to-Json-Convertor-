# XLS-to-Json-Convertor-
Made a software which converts the excel file in a required JSON format.  Using Html5 FileReader (), I instantiated a FileReader object to read its contents into memory.  Simply using FileReader () wonâ€™t read the excel file therefore I used XLSX to read the file to Obtain the Current Row as CSV and converting each line to JSON format.  Finally I converted JSON into required JSON String using Regx.
